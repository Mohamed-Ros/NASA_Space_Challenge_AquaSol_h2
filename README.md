## Approch Of Calculation


```
1- chemisrty_anylsis.m
>> Will Get The equation Of calculation which use to Calculate the number of joles need and how much day need
------------------------------------------
"chemisrty_anylsis Results "
Density of water: 1 kg/m³
Number of moles of water: 16666.6667
Number of moles of hydrogen: 16666.6667
Mass of hydrogen: 33333.3333 kg
Number of joules produced: 4000000000000 J
Change in temperature: 8391.6084 °C
Total final temperature: 8416.6084 °C
Number of days at 330°C: 25.5049 days

------------------------------------------
2 - physic_anylsis.m 
>> Will get the amount of Kilowatt output per day 
" physic_anylsis Results " 
Total kilowatt-hours needed: 1263.8914
Accurate kilowatt-hours (adjusted for efficiency): 1805.5592
Kilowatt output per hour: 11.7549
Kilowatt output per day: 70.5297 
--------------------------------------------------
3 - Resb Pi.py 
>> Will Get The Iot System of Resbi To Control for hydrogen
Notes :- 
"
We cannot measure the pressure of the flowing hydrogen mathematically, as the givens aren't sufficient, so we have to measure it manually. Using a sensor, we will try many amounts of hydrogen at specific times until we get the pressure required in Raspberry Pi to reach the required temperature.
